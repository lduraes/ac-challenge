#Luiz Duraes - Test - 28/03/2016


##Architecture 
I do not like using Apple's MVC architecture because I reckon that UIViewControllers get massive. As a result, I would rather using some patterns instead. 

Most of friends who also work with mobile know the architecture that I applied in this challenge. I do not really know its name, I think that is pretty similar to VIPER (*), however I have already read some articles which showed me a different approach (at manager layer).

##3rd libraries
0. Cocoapods

##If I would have more time...
- Send a second version of this test written in Swift
- Add Calabash library as well as functional tests
