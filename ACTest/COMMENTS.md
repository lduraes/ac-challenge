#Luiz Duraes - Test - 28/03/2016


##Architecture 
I do not like using Apple's MVC architecture because I reckon that UIViewControllers get massive. As a result, I would rather using some patterns instead. 

Most of friends who also work with mobile know the architecture that I applied in this challenge. I do not really know its name, I think that is pretty similar to VIPER (*), however I have already read some articles which showed me a different approach (at manager layer).

##3rd libraries
0. Cocoapods
0. Reskit
0. SVProgressHUD

##If I would have more time...
- Try to write it in Swift

##Unfinished tasks
0. I would finish XCTests
0. I would add Calabash library as well as a functional test (perhaps it could count as a plus) 


#PS
In case of any doubt, please feel free to contact me.

Cheers.
