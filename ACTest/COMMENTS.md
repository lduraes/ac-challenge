#Luiz Duraes - Test - 14/03/2016


##Architecture 
I do not like using Apple's MVC architecture because I reckon that UIViewControllers get massive. As a result, I would rather using some patterns instead. 

Most of friends who also work with mobile know the architecture that I applied in this challenge. I do not really know its name, I think that is pretty similar to VIPER (*), however I have already read somo articles which showed me a different approach (at manager layer).

##3rd libraries
0. Cocoapods
0. Reskit

##If I would have more time...
- Finished my challenge
- Add some customized spinners, such as: SVProgressHUD (3rd library)
- Try to write it in Swift

##Unfinished task
0. I could not create the relationship between Restkit objects in order to display the expected result on screen
0. I would use Restkit correctly, I mean integrating objects with CoreData
0. I would finish XCTests
0. I would add Calabash library as well as a functional test (perhaps it could count as a plus) 


#PS
Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to complete this challenge, I am sorry. As I already had informed to recruiter, I did not this that I would have to time to get this done during the last weekend. 

Anyway, please find below the architecture used as well as another questions asked.

In case of any doubt, please feel free to contact me.

Cheers.
